# DynamicQR_Generation
An IoT-based project to display a QR code that contains a real-time sensor database 

What is this project all about ?
  In this project, I create a QR code that contains the details of a database window that contains 
status of a real-time sensor.

Requisites 
    Basic knowledge of sensor,arduino.
    Knowledge to work with arduino Cloud 
    Basic knowledge of Python 

--> In this program I've used the Arduino cloud service as it is easy to use also interactive 
--> Log on to https://cloud.arduino.cc/home/
--> Set up your profile 
--> Now create a new sketch and follow the procedure given on the website to set up your workspace 
--> Now as soon as you enter the editor you can find the Arduino cloud already sets up the cloud 
--> Now program your sensor. In this project, I used an LDR sensor and observed its light intensity and  
    the light on or off.
--> Now set up the dashboard .
--> Your cloud is good to go!!
--> Now it's time to code !! please copy the link of the dashboard and paste it in the Python code where the link is provided.
--> Execute the python file to find the QR code .
--> scan it to observe the dashboard .
